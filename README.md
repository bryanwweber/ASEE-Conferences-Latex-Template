ASEE Conferences Latex Template
===============================

A Latex template for ASEE conference proceedings papers.

ASEE provides a list of formatting requirements on its [webite](http://www.asee.org/conferences-and-events/conferences).

## For the abstract
### Title:
1. Title: The title must be centered with at least a one and one-half inch margin on the left and 
right. 
2. Font: Times New Roman typeface is required, bold faced, 14 point.
3. Author and Affiliation: Submissions are done in a double blind. No author or affiliation 
information is to be included on any abstracts.
4. Footers: Do not include any in your abstract.


### Body of the Abstract (beginning under title information)
1. Format: The document will be in a one-column format with left justification.
There must be a 1 inch margin on the left, right, and bottom. 
2. Font: Times New Roman typeface is required, 12 point, skipping one line between paragraphs.
3. Length: Abstracts should generally be between 250 - 500 words.


### Biographical Information
Biographical information is to be saved in Monolith on the Author/Co-Author page. It will be 
automatically added to your paper at the end of the process.

### Other
Do not include session numbers in any part of the document, unless specifically requested to 
do so by a call for papers.
Do not include any author or affiliation information in any part of your abstract so that your 
abstract is able to receive a blind review.

### Additional Guidelines and Suggestions:
* As appropriate, include the pedagogical theory or approach being used;
* Indicate the form that your outcome(s) will take as appropriate;
* As applicable, methods of assessment should be made clear;
* A second page may be used to include a graph or image to clarify the nature of your work or 
to include limited references to indicate a basis for the work undertaken.
